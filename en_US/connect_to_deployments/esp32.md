# Connect with ESP32

This article mainly introduces how to use `PubSubClient` in the ESP32 project, including implementing the connection, subscription, messaging, and other functions between the client and MQTT broker.

[ESP32](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32) is an upgraded version of ESP8266 and is an ideal choice for IoT projects. In addition to the Wi-Fi module, ESP32 also includes a Bluetooth 4.0 module. The dual-core CPU operates at a frequency of 80 to 240 MHz. It contains two Wi-Fi and Bluetooth modules and various input and output pins.

## Preconditions

> 1.  The deployment has been created. You can view connection-related information under Deployment Overview. Please make sure that the deployment status is running. At the same time, you can use WebSocket to test the connection to the MQTT server.
> 2.  Set the user name and password in `Authentication & ACL` > `Authentication` for connection verification.

This article uses the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) as the code editor and uploader. The open-source Arduino Software (IDE) makes it easy to write code and upload it to the board. This software can be used with any Arduino board.

## Installation Dependencies

In Arduino IDE, complete the following installations:

1. Install ESP32 development board.
   Click **Tools** -> **Development Board** -> **Development Board Management**. Search ESP32 and click **Install**.
2. Install PubSub client.
   Click**Project** -> **Load library** -> **Library manager...**. Search PubSubClient and Install PubSubClient by Nick Oâ€™Leary.

## Connect to MQTT Broker

> Please find the relevant address and port information in the Deployment Overview of the Console. Please note that if it is the basic edition, the port is not 1883 or 8883, please confirm the port.

### Connection Settings

This article will use the [free public MQTT broker](https://www.emqx.com/en/mqtt/public-mqtt5-broker) provided by EMQX. This service is created based on the [EMQX Cloud](https://www.emqx.com/en/cloud). The information about broker access is as follows:

- Broker: **broker.emqx.io**
- TCP Port: **1883**
- WebSocket Port: **8083**

After you finish the connection settings, follow the steps below to write codes in Arduino IDE:

1. Import the WiFi and PubSubClient libraries.

```c
#include <WiFi.h>
#include <PubSubClient.h>
```

2. Set the Wi-Fi name and password, the MQTT server connection address and port. Set the topic to `esp32/test`.

```c
// WiFi
const char *ssid = "mousse"; // Enter your WiFi name
const char *password = "qweqweqwe";  // Enter WiFi password

// MQTT Broker
const char *mqtt_broker = "broker.emqx.io";
const char *topic = "esp32/test";
const char *mqtt_username = "emqx";
const char *mqtt_password = "public";
const int mqtt_port = 1883;
```

3. Open a serial connection for outputting the results of the program and connecting to the Wi-Fi network.

```c
// Set software serial baud to 115200;
Serial.begin(115200);
// connecting to a WiFi network
WiFi.begin(ssid, password);
while (WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED) {
    delay(500);
    Serial.println("Connecting to WiFi..");
}
```

4. Use PubSubClient to connect to the Public MQTT broker.

```c
client.setServer(mqtt_broker, mqtt_port);
client.setCallback(callback);
while (!client.connected()) {
    String client_id = "esp32-client-";
    client_id += String(WiFi.macAddress());
    Serial.printf("The client %s connects to the public mqtt broker\n", client_id.c_str());
    if (client.connect(client_id.c_str(), mqtt_username, mqtt_password)) {
        Serial.println("Public emqx mqtt broker connected");
    } else {
        Serial.print("failed with state ");
        Serial.print(client.state());
        delay(2000);
    }
}
```

5. After the MQTT server is successfully connected, ESP32 can publish messages on topic `ESP32/test` to the MQTT server and subscribe to messages on topic `esp32/test`.

```c
// publish and subscribe
client.publish(topic, "Hi EMQX I'm ESP32 ^^");
client.subscribe(topic);
```

6. Set the callback function to print the topic name to the serial port and print the message received from the topic `esp32/test`.

```c
void callback(char *topic, byte *payload, unsigned int length) {
    Serial.print("Message arrived in topic: ");
    Serial.println(topic);
    Serial.print("Message:");
    for (int i = 0; i < length; i++) {
        Serial.print((char) payload[i]);
    }
    Serial.println();
    Serial.println("-----------------------");
}
```

The complete code is displayed as follows:

```c
#include <WiFi.h>
#include <PubSubClient.h>

// WiFi
const char *ssid = "mousse"; // Enter your WiFi name
const char *password = "qweqweqwe";  // Enter WiFi password

// MQTT Broker
const char *mqtt_broker = "broker.emqx.io";
const char *topic = "esp32/test";
const char *mqtt_username = "emqx";
const char *mqtt_password = "public";
const int mqtt_port = 1883;

WiFiClient espClient;
PubSubClient client(espClient);

void setup() {
 // Set software serial baud to 115200;
 Serial.begin(115200);
 // connecting to a WiFi network
 WiFi.begin(ssid, password);
 while (WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED) {
     delay(500);
     Serial.println("Connecting to WiFi..");
 }
 Serial.println("Connected to the WiFi network");
 //connecting to a mqtt broker
 client.setServer(mqtt_broker, mqtt_port);
 client.setCallback(callback);
 while (!client.connected()) {
     String client_id = "esp32-client-";
     client_id += String(WiFi.macAddress());
     Serial.printf("The client %s connects to the public mqtt broker\n", client_id.c_str());
     if (client.connect(client_id.c_str(), mqtt_username, mqtt_password)) {
         Serial.println("Public emqx mqtt broker connected");
     } else {
         Serial.print("failed with state ");
         Serial.print(client.state());
         delay(2000);
     }
 }
 // publish and subscribe
 client.publish(topic, "Hi EMQX I'm ESP32 ^^");
 client.subscribe(topic);
}

void callback(char *topic, byte *payload, unsigned int length) {
 Serial.print("Message arrived in topic: ");
 Serial.println(topic);
 Serial.print("Message:");
 for (int i = 0; i < length; i++) {
     Serial.print((char) payload[i]);
 }
 Serial.println();
 Serial.println("-----------------------");
}

void loop() {
 client.loop();
}
```

## Test Connection

After the client has successfully connected to the MQTT broker, you can use the Arduino IDE and MQTT X to test the connection.

1. Open the serial monitor, select 115200 baud rate, and check the ESP32 connection status.

2. Establish the connection between MQTT X client and MQTT broker, and send messages on topic `ESP32/test`.

## More

In summary, we have created an MQTT connection in an ESP32 project, and simulated the connecting, subscribing, sending and receiving messages between the client and MQTT broker. You can download the source code of the example [here](https://github.com/emqx/MQTT-Client-Examples/tree/master/mqtt-client-ESP32), and you can also find more demo examples in other languages on [GitHub](https://github.com/emqx/MQTT-Client-Examples).
