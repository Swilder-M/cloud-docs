# Serverless connection guide


### What's MQTT over TLS/SSL and WebSocket over TLS/SSLï¼Ÿ

Add TLS/SSL encryption to MQTT or WebSocket protocol communication to ensure that the communication is secure from eavesdropping and tampering.

The MQTT over TLS/SSL port is 8883, which corresponds to the 'mqtts', and the WebSocket over TLS/SSL port is 8084, which corresponds to the 'wss'.



### Why does Serverless only support MQTT over TLS/SSL or WebSocket over TLS/SSL?

Serverless is based on the EMQX multi-tenancy architecture, with multiple users sharing an EMQX cluster. MQTT and WebSocket using TLS encryption provide security and reliability of data transmission.


### How to write client-side code for TLS/SSL connection?

You can ckeck sample code (TLS-related sample code) to write client-side code.

**CA file**

Serverless uses one-way TLS. EMQX provides and maintains server-side CA. Some clients may need a server-side CA for verification, please [download here](https://assets.emqx.com/data/emqxsl-ca.crt).
